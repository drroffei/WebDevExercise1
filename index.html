                The <strong>yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> <em>(Caligavis chrysops)</em> is a small to medium-sized bird
                in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater">honeyeater</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" target="_blank">family</a>, Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific
                names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins
                twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia,
                in open <span> forests from coastal </span>dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands
                along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted
                to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants,
                such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning 
                them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands migrate northwards between March
                and May to spend the winter in southern Queensland, and return in July and August to breed in southern 
                New South Wales and Victoria. They form socially monogamous pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate
                cup-shaped nest. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.
            </p>
             <p>   
                Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be of least concern for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was first described, and placed in the genus Sylvia, by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae.[2][3] French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English zoologist George Robert Gray as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.[4] The specific name chrysops is derived from the Ancient Greek words chrysos meaning 'gold' and prosopo meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.[5]</p>

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011.[4] Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling, confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic.[6] Five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the mitochondrial DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus Caligavis. The generic name derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.[7] The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus.[8] A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.[9]</p>

            <p>There are three subspecies of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by Gregory Mathews in 1912.[10][11] There are only very slight differences between the nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, and C. c. barroni from the Clarke Range and the Atherton Tableland in Queensland. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly not worthy of recognition" by the Handbook of the Birds of the World.[12]</p>

            <p>The Surgeon-General of New South Wales John White caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was published in 1790.[13] Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler.[2] John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has become its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.[15]</p>

            <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater is a medium-small, greyish-brown bird that takes its common name from distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of the head.[16] Yellow feathers form a narrow stripe above the gape, which broadens and curves below the eye to end in a small white patch of feathers on the ear coverts. Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the remiges combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The iris is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, 0.8 g (0.03 oz) heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages 15-17.5 centimetres (5.9-6.9 in) in length, with a wingspan of 21.5-26 cm (8.5-10.2 in), and a weight of 12.5-20.5 grams (0.44-0.72 oz), with an average of 17 g (0.60 oz)).[12][15]</p>

            <p class="subSubTitle" id="vocalizations">Vocalizations</p>
            <p>One of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.[15] The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived.[16] Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.[15]</p>
